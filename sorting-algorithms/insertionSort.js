/* Insertion Sort

   Description :
   Insertion sort is a step more complex but a bit more useful than bubble sort
   and is occasionally useful. The worst case scenario for it is similar to bubble sort's 
   but its best case makes it suited for times when you're pretty sure a list almost 
   sorted or likely already sorted.

   Working:
   We're going to start at the beginning of the list and 
   assume we have a sorted list of length 1 where the first element 
   is only sorted element. We're then going to grab the second element, 
   and insert it into the correct spot in our sorted list, 
   either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger 
   than our first element. We now have a sorted list of length 2. We then 
   continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the 
   list as the unsorted side dwindles.

   Big O:
   What's the Big O? There's an inner loop that goes over your sorted list 
   to find the correct place to insert your item, and an outer loop to go 
   over all the numbers. Two loops means O(nÂ²). However since if your list is 
   sorted or nearly so, it can be O(n) in a best case scenario and thus well 
   adapted to that scenario.
